The "Census Project" focuses on analyzing 1881 census data from a UK town to provide valuable insights and recommendations for future services and development. 
The associated Jupyter Notebook showcases Python code for data cleaning and manipulation, encompassing exploratory analysis, and insightful visualization. 
The project utilizes various Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations, and pandas-profiling for creating dashboards and reports. 
The analysis delves into demographic data including religion, marital status, employment, infirmity, migration, employment trends, commuters, and occupancy rates, yielding actionable insights for forward-looking planning. 
Key aspects covered encompass population demographics, birth and death rates, migration patterns, and resulting recommendations such as constructing a train station, investing in low-density housing, giving precedence to elderly care services, and considering potential growth scenarios.
